# Hi, I’m Karl 👋

I’m a **technical product manager** who turns messy logistics workflows into usable software.

I started on the engineering side, moved into product, and now sit in the middle of **shipping & logistics, AI, and hands-on delivery** — building tools that help operations teams move goods, information, and decisions faster.

---

## 🧭 What I Work On

### 📌 Product Strategy & Discovery
- Turn vague goals like “improve customer self-service” into **clear problem statements**.
- Use **Opportunity Solution Trees, Lean Canvas, structured interviews, and service blueprints** to prioritize what to build (and what to ignore).
- Obsess over **end-to-end journeys**: booking → documentation → execution → customer support.

### ⚙️ Technical Product Management
- Translate constraints between **engineers** and **business stakeholders**.
- Think in terms of **architecture, APIs, data flows, and trade-offs**, not just screens.
- Keep decisions grounded in **constraints, risks, and lifecycle cost**, not just “nice” UX.

### 🤖 AI-Augmented Product Builder
- Treat AI as **infrastructure for workflows**, not a buzzword.
- Work on **RAG-style assistants**, internal research agents, and tools that reduce repetitive PM/ops work.
- Use AI daily for **research, flow generation, prototyping, and validation**.

## 🧩 How I Work: Product Development Flow + AI Assist

I use a fairly consistent flow from idea → shipped feature → monitored outcome. Tools change over time; the core steps stay similar.

### 1. Ideas & Problem Shaping
- Collect inputs from customers, ops teams, data, and market signals.
- Use AI to **summarize feedback, cluster themes, and draft problem statements**.
- **Output**: a shortlist of clearly framed problems, not raw feature requests.

### 2. Pick Ideas & Define the Bet
- Assess ideas against **impact, effort, risk, and strategic fit**.
- Use AI to **simulate scenarios**, propose alternatives, and challenge assumptions.
- **Output**: 1–3 “bets” worth deeper discovery.

### 3. PRD / Concept Brief
- Draft a concise PRD: **problem, users, scope, constraints, success metrics**.
- Use AI as a **co-writer** for structure, edge cases, and “what could go wrong?” checks.
- **Output**: a shared concept document the team can argue with.

### 4. User Story Map & Journeys
- Map the end-to-end flow (e.g., booking → documentation → tracking → support).
- Use AI to **suggest missing steps, failure paths, and UX variations**.
- **Output**: a story map or service blueprint that becomes the backbone for slicing work.

### 5. Backlog & Story List
- Break flows into stories, constraints, and technical tasks.
- Use AI to **draft initial user stories and acceptance criteria**, which I refine manually with the team.
- **Output**: a structured backlog (in the team’s chosen tool) linked back to the story map.

### 6. Story Details & Edge Cases
- Clarify details with engineers, designers, and domain experts.
- Use AI to **generate edge-case lists, validation rules, and example payloads**.
- **Output**: story-level specs that are just enough for dev + QA to build and test.

### 7. UAT & Pre-release Validation
- Define UAT scenarios and success criteria with stakeholders.
- Use AI to **expand test scenarios, summarize findings, and spot patterns** in feedback.
- **Output**: UAT reports and decisions on go/no-go or iteration.

### 8. Release & Success Metrics Monitoring
- Coordinate releases with engineering, ops, and support (phased rollouts when possible).
- Instrument features with **event tracking and key metrics** (adoption, funnel, error rates, lead times).
- Use AI to **summarize dashboards, highlight anomalies, and connect quantitative signals with qualitative feedback**.
- **Output**: a clear view of whether the bet is working, and a list of follow-up improvements or rollback conditions.

AI doesn’t replace discovery or decisions — it **compresses the busywork** so I can spend more time on framing, trade-offs, and alignment.

## 🚢 My Domain: Shipping, Logistics & eCommerce

Most of my work sits around:

- **Ocean shipping & documentation** – booking flows, shipping instructions, BL/VGM/manifest workflows, compliance checks.
- **Operations dashboards & self-service tools** – enabling local offices, forwarders, and small shippers to get answers without email chaos.
- **SMB logistics & eCommerce** – at VX Solutions, helping smaller businesses in Vietnam digitize exports, inventory, and cross-border flows.

I can talk both languages:

- Carrier rules, HS codes, cut-off times, and local office constraints.  
- Services, APIs, UX patterns, data models, and technical feasibility.

## 🚀 Product Work at VX Solutions

> Public-facing projects where I can share more detail. Descriptions focus on the **problems, product decisions, and outcomes** rather than internal implementation.

### 1️⃣ Document Management System for Shipping Documents  
🔗 **https://vxsolutions.tech/showcases/container-shipping/document-management-system**

**Context**  
Freight and logistics companies still rely heavily on scattered PDFs, email attachments, and shared folders for critical documents.

**What I worked on**
- Defined a **cloud-based document system** tailored to logistics workflows.
- Identified the most painful steps in **finding, sharing, and keeping documents compliant**.
- Designed features like **expiring document alerts, structured metadata, role-based access**, and integration points.

**Impact (qualitative)**
- Key shipment and contract documents became **searchable and shareable in seconds**.
- Reduced risk of **missed renewals**.
- Created a stepping stone for future **AI-powered document recognition & search**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Comfort Zone

- **Product & Delivery** – Value creation, product & business discovery, backlog management, roadmapping, discovery frameworks, stakeholder alignment.
- **Design Collaboration** – Wireframes, journey maps, and service blueprints with designers and domain experts.
- **Technical** – Comfortable discussing APIs, services, and data models. I build my own prototypes (scripts, demo apps) and query production-like data to uncover insights. Enough hands-on to collaborate effectively with engineers without doing full implementation work.
